# Ceasor-Cipher-Algorithm
Encryption of message with ceasor cipher algorithm using python

# The two python scripts will do Encryption and Decryption of messages or data using ceasor cipher algorithm.
These methods are mostly used in cyber security when involving confidential or private messages.

# The first program does simple cipher encription, whereas;
# The second program does both Encryption and Decryption of cipher algorithms
